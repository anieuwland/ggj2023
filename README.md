# Rooting for You
![Fight for your juice](https://github.com/anieuwland/ggj2023/blob/main/resources/video/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

Rooting for you is a beat 'em up built for the Global Game Jam 2023 (Hogeschool van Amsterdam). The theme was Roots. 

We interpreted the theme as root vegetables fighting for lives, risking being juiced, making our game more of a *juice* 'em up. 

It is built in Godot 3.5.1 and tested to work on Linux and Mac OS X.
